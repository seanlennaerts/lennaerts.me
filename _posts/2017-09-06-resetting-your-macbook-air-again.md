So that last guide didn't work :cry:. Let's try this again then.

1. Make sure your MacBook Air is updated to 10.12.4 or later. To check, turn on your laptop like you normally would. Click on the Apple in the top left corner and then About This Mac. I'm still on El Capitan and you can see my version is 10.11.6.

2. If you are on 10.12.4 (or later) skip to step 3 :blush:. Otherwise you need to go to the App Store and update your laptop!

3. Shut down your laptop and turn it back on. This time hold down <kbd>⌥</kbd> (option) + <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> until you see a spinning globe. It might ask you to connect to the internet so choose your wifi and continue.

4. When it finally finishes loading you should see this once again:

5. Please make sure that one of the options is "Reinstall macOS" and not "Reinstall Mac OS X". If it does say the latter then text me I guess :unamused:.

6. Otherwise repeat steps 3-9 from the first guide and you're done! :tada: :confetti_ball:
