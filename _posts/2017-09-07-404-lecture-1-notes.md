I just realized this is the only class you're going to miss so I can return to just writing the date on Tuesday.

There wasn't much to take notes on today. We spent like a half hour walking through the syllabus. Then he handed out the lecture slides for today and we went through those. In the last half hour we got two more handouts that we went through. I annotated those a little :muscle:.

I don't think he's uploading the handouts from today so I scanned them here:

- [Course Syllabus](/assets/{{ page.title }}/Course Syllabus.compressed.pdf)
- [Lecture 1 slides](/assets/{{ page.title }}/Lecture 1 slides.compressed.pdf)
- [Handout 1 - DB2 Case Study](/assets/{{ page.title }}/Handout 1 DB2 Case Study.compressed.pdf)
- [Handout 2 - Indexes](/assets/{{ page.title }}/Handout 2 Indexes.compressed.pdf)

Finally you should sign up for the course's Piazza [here](https://piazza.com/ubc.ca/winterterm12017/cpsc404). The course code is: `db2_for_zOS`.
