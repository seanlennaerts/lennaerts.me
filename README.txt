# Setup

See [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) for more information about running lennaerts.me locally for testing.

1. `rbenv global 2.4.2` make sure you're not on system since you can't install gems to system's gem directory
2. `gem install bundler`
3. `bundle install` uses the Gemfile to install the necessary dependencies
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start server
5. Done :)
